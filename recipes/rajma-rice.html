            <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
            <p>Rajma Rice is a classic <em>North Indian</em> comfort food that brings together tender red kidney beans
                cooked in
                a thick,
                flavorful gravy made with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and a blend of traditional Indian spices. The curry
                is
                slow-cooked to perfection, allowing the spices to infuse deeply into the beans, creating a rich and
                hearty
                dish
                that is both satisfying and nutritious. </p>

            <p>Served over a bed of steaming basmati rice, Rajma Rice is a wholesome, vegetarian meal loved across
                generations.
                Its comforting flavors and balanced nutrition make it a popular choice not just in Indian homes, but
                also
                among
                food lovers worldwide seeking a taste of authentic Indian cuisine.</p>
